# Project Watcher
A Mastodon bot written in Python that watches for various releases on Github. Currently focuses more on Pine64-related projects, but more projects will probably be added later. See it in action here: @projectwatcher@botsin.space

This project requires `requests` and `Mastodon.py` from pip in order to function. Everything else is either default in Python or will request creation.
